Above is a simplified example of a Spring Boot application integrated with Apache Kafka, tested both via Kafka command line tools and through Postman. The application consists of a Kafka configuration class defining the necessary Kafka beans, a message listener service to consume messages from a Kafka topic, and a REST controller to produce messages to the same topic. This setup allows for seamless communication with Kafka, leveraging Spring Boot's ease of development and Kafka's messaging capabilities. Messages can be sent to the Kafka topic using Postman through a POST request to the specified endpoint, while Kafka command line tools can be used to monitor and manage the Kafka instance. This integration demonstrates a practical use case of Kafka within a Spring Boot application, providing a robust and scalable solution for real-time messaging and event-driven architectures.
In addition to the described setup, the application can also utilize real-time API endpoints like Wikimedia's https://stream.wikimedia.org/v2/stream/recentchange to consume and process real-time data from Wikimedia's recent changes stream, enriching the application's functionality with live updates from Wikipedia.
